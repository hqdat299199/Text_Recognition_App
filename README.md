# Text_Recognition_App
Please download Python 3.7, install and add necessary libraries before run form1.py
Please download QtDesigner for Windows, link: https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download, and after that you can open form1.ui
If you want to convert from .ui file to .py file, install PyQt6 using pip command: pip install pyqt6 and then run command: 
- example: pyuic6 -x name of your .ui file -o name of your .py file (you can put the name of your .py file similar to name of your .ui file)
